/**
 * An egg consists of 1 or more egglets.
 * Each egglet contains the information about one file or directory.
 *
 * The egglet format:
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 *  - 'magic_number':    byte 0 in every egglet must be 0x63 (ASCII 'c')
 *
 *  - 'egglet_format':   byte 1 in every egglet must be one of
 *                       0x36, 0x37, 0x38 (ASCII '6', '7' '8')
 *
 *  - 'mode':            bytes 2-11 are the type and permissions as
 *                       a ls(1)-like character array; e.g., "-rwxr-xr-x"
 *
 *  - 'pathname_length': bytes 12-13 are an unsigned 2-byte (16-bit)
 *                       little-endian integer, giving the length of the
 *                       file path that was give
 *
 *  - 'pathname':        the filename of the object in this egglet.
 *                       this is 'pathname_length' bytes long.
 *
 *  - 'content_length':  the next bytes are an unsigned 6-byte (48-bit)
 *                       little-endian integer, giving the length of the
 *                       file that was encoded
 *
 *  - 'contents':        the data of the object in this egglet.
 *                       this is 'content_length' bytes long.
 *
 *  - 'hash':            the last byte of an egglet is a `egglet_hash'
 *                       of all bytes of this egglet except this byte.
 *
 *
 * egglet content encodings:
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 *  - egglet format 0x38 ('8'):
 *    `contents' is a plain array of bytes.
 *
 *  - egglet format 0x37 ('7'):
 *    `contents' is an array of bytes of packed seven-bit values where
 *    the trailing bits in the last byte are zero.
 *
 *    This format can store any seven bit values --- so, for example,
 *    any valid ASCII can be stored.
 *
 *    This format needs to store ceil((7.0/8) * content_length) bytes.
 *
 *  - egglet format 0x36 ('6'):
 *    `contents' is an array of bytes of packed six-bit values where the
 *    trailing bits in the last byte are zero, and which are translated
 *    by functions `chicken_6_bit.c'.
 *
 *    This format cannot store all of ASCII!
 *
 *    This format needs to store ceil((6.0/8) * content_length) bytes.
 *
 *
 * Packed n-bit encoding:
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 * We often store smaller values inside larger types.  For example, the
 * integer 42 only needs six bits; but we often will store it in a full
 * thirty-two-bit integer, wasting many bits of zeroes.  Assuming we
 * know how many bits the value needs, we could only store the relevant
 * bits.
 *
 * For example, let's say we have three seven-bit values `a', `b', `c',
 * made up of arbitrary bitstrings, and stored in eight-bit variables
 *
 *     a: 0b0AAA_AAAA,  b: 0b0BBB_BBBB,  c: 0b0CCC_CCCC,
 *
 * then a packed seven-bit encoding of these values in order would be:
 *
 *        0bAAAA_AAAB_BBBB_BBCC_CCCC_C???
 *
 * However, we have a problem: what happens to the trailing bits, which
 * don't have a value?  Note that we've defined all trailing bits to be
 * zero above, which would here give:
 *
 *        0bAAAA_AAAB_BBBB_BBCC_CCCC_C000
 *
